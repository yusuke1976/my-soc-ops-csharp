## How to Use a Checkpoint

### Option 1: Copy files to your project
```bash
# From repo root, copy a checkpoint's SocOps folder
cp -r .solutions/step-04-redesign-cyberpunk/SocOps ./SocOps
```

### Option 2: Run a checkpoint directly
```bash
cd .solutions/step-04-redesign-cyberpunk
dotnet run --project SocOps/SocOps.csproj
```

### Option 3: Compare your changes
```bash
# See what changed in a step
diff -r SocOps .solutions/step-04-redesign-cyberpunk/SocOps
```
