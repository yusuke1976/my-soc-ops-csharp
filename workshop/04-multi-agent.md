> ⏱️ **Time:** ~20 minutes

Build new features using specialized agents: TDD agents for reliable code, and design agents for beautiful UI.

## 🧪 Task 1: Scavenger Hunt Mode (TDD-Driven)

Custom agents with handoffs break complex workflows into smaller steps, keeping you in control for critical decisions.

### What We're Building

A new **Scavenger Hunt** mode:
- Same questions as bingo
- Displayed as a simple checklist
- Progress meter at the top
- Click to mark items complete

### Steps

#### Phase 1: Plan

1. Start a new Chat in **Plan Mode**
2. Enter:
   ```
   Add a new Scavenger Hunt mode: same questions, but shown as a 
   simple list with checkboxes and a progress meter
   ```
3. **Iterate on the plan** — check that it:
   - ✅ Adds the mode to the start screen
   - ✅ Creates a new component for the list view
   - ✅ Includes a progress indicator
   - ❌ Doesn't go overboard with features

#### Phase 2: TDD Red (Write Failing Tests)

1. Select **TDD Red** agent
2. Click **Start**
3. Watch as it writes tests for:
   - Component rendering
   - Checkbox interactions
   - Progress calculation
   - State management

4. Check VS Code's **Test Explorer** to see the failing tests

#### Phase 3: TDD Green (Make Tests Pass)

1. When Red is done, select **TDD Green** agent
2. Watch as it:
   - Implements the minimum code to pass tests
   - Runs tests after each change
   - Iterates until all tests pass

#### Phase 4: Refactor (Clean Up)

1. Select **TDD Refactor** agent
2. Let it clean up the code while keeping tests green

### Checkpoint Recovery

If something goes wrong:
1. Use Chat **Checkpoints** to revert
2. Reset to before "TDD Red" started
3. Try again with adjusted prompts

> 💡 **Bonus:** Try **TDD Supervisor** for a fully automated TDD flow

✅ **Result:** A fully tested Scavenger Hunt feature built with disciplined TDD!

## 🎴 Task 2: Card Deck Mode (Design-Driven)

Use the **Pixel Jam** agent to focus on UI iteration while building new features.

### What We're Building

A new **Card Deck Shuffle** mode:
- Player opens the game
- Taps to get a random card
- Card flips with animation
- Shows a question to discuss

### Steps

1. Start a new Chat
2. Select **Pixel Jam** as the agent
3. Enter:
   ```
   New mode: Card Deck Shuffle. Every player opens the game, 
   taps, and gets a random card with a question
   ```
4. Watch as it iterates on the UI
5. Follow up to refine:
   ```
   Add a cool 3D flip animation when revealing the card
   ```
   ```
   Make the card styling match the cyberpunk theme
   ```
6. **Commit** when you're happy

### What Pixel Jam Does Differently

- Focuses on **visual design** first
- Iterates on **UI/UX** before logic
- Uses the frontend design instructions
- Creates polished, animated interfaces

## 🔍 Task 3: UX Review Agent

Combine MCP tools, custom workflows, and subagent isolation for powerful review capabilities.

### Steps

1. Start a new Chat with **Pixel Jam**
2. Enter:
   ```
   Run review
   ```
3. When prompted, click **Allow for this Workspace** for Playwright tool access
4. Watch as it:
   - Takes screenshots of each page
   - Analyzes usability issues
   - Checks accessibility
   - Reviews visual consistency

### What Gets Reviewed

| Category | Checks |
|----------|--------|
| **Usability** | Navigation flow, button clarity, feedback |
| **Accessibility** | Color contrast, keyboard nav, screen readers |
| **Visual** | Consistency, spacing, alignment |
| **Interaction** | Touch targets, hover states, animations |

### Follow-Up Actions

After the review:
```
File the critical findings as GitHub issues
```
```
Fix the accessibility issues you found
```
```
Assign the navigation bug to a background agent
```

✅ **Result:** A comprehensive UX review with actionable findings!
